    <h3>About RBP</h3>
    <p>In Robot Beer Pong, teams write RISC-V machine code that controls a robot to play beer pong against other teams who did the same thing; each time your robot 'drinks', bits are randomly flipped and the robot gets more <i>silly</i>.  Uploading your code to this site will automatically enter you into the competition.  To see your code playing, go to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP5agq3Ecu9hfiI0XkI4r6A">YouTube livestream</a>.</p>

    <h3>RBP Nitty-Gritty</h3>
    <p>Robot Beer Pong is turn based.  At the beginning of your robot's turn, the ball is place on your magnet, the <code>PC</code> is set to zero, and your code executes until you call <code>EBREAK</code>.  Once you call <code>EBREAK</code>, code execution terminates, the ball is released, and Newton takes over.</p>
    <p>You have 5 seconds to complete a turn and the processor runs at a speedy 1kHz.</p>
